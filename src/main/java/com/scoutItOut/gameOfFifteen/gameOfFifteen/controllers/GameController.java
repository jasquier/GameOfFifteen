 * This class will be used to control the overall game loop of the game of fifteen.
 * Front end requests will be made to the game controller requesting a board or sending back a board with
 *  a previous boards id to check for a valid move.
 *
 *  Front end needs to be able to
 *  - request a new game
 *  - send a game board along with an id to a board in a state previous to the move requested
 *  -- should we just send two game boards old and new?
